Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use with Open Street Map data. This repository is comprised of tools build on top of the various other valhalla libraries.

Build Status
------------

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/valhalla/tools.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/valhalla/tools)

Building
--------

Our tools use the [GNU Build System](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/GNU-Build-System.html) to configure and build itself. To install on a Debian or Ubuntu system you need to install its dependencies with:

    scripts/dependencies.sh

And then run to install it:

    scripts/install.sh

Please see `./configure --help` for more options on how to control the build process.

Using
-----

For detailed information about what algorithms, data structures and executables are contained within tools, please see the more [detailed documentation](docs/index.md).

The build will produce binaries mostly in the form of command line executable tools. Tools, and all of the projects under the Valhalla organization use the [MIT License](COPYING).

Contributing
------------

We welcome contributions to our tools. If you would like to report an issue, or even better fix an existing one, please use the [tools issue tracker](https://github.com/valhalla/tools/issues) on GitHub.

If you would like to make an improvement to the code, please be aware that all valhalla projects are written mostly in C++11, in the K&R (1TBS variant) with two spaces as indentation. We welcome contributions as pull requests to the [repository](https://github.com/valhalla/tools) and highly recommend that your pull request include a test to validate the addition/change of functionality.

Tests
-----

We highly encourage running and updating the tests to make sure no regressions have been made. We use the Automake test suite to run our tests by simply making the `check` target:

    make check

You can also build a test coverage report. This requires that the packages `lcov`, `gcov` and `genhtml` be installed. On Ubuntu you can get these with:

    sudo apt-get install lcov

To make the coverage report, configure the build for it:

    ./configure --enable-coverage

And generate an HTML coverage report in the `coverage/` directory:

    make coverage-report

Note also that, because calculating the coverage requires compiler support, you will need to clean any object files from a non-coverage build by running `make clean` before `make coverage-report`.
