These scripts and files will be throw away after we use gtfs from transitland.

These scripts import feeds from NYC via ./makeNYC.sh.  Prerequisites for the
scripts are:  1.  Install postgresql and create a gtfs db.  2.  Spatial 
enable the db via: CREATE EXTENSION postgis;  3.  Update dbuser var in
build_schedule.sh and import.sh to your db username.  4.  Install csvfilter
via: sudo pip install csvfilter.

Run ./makeNYC.sh

This will create the gtfs tables from the feeds.  It will also create a 
schedule table for stop pairs.

NOTE:  LIRR puts all of the calendar entries in the calendar_dates.txt
file.  Therefore, you will see an error for their feed:
ERROR:  could not open file "/data/valhalla/mjolnir/gtfs/schedule.txt" for reading: No such file or directory

Please disregard this error.
